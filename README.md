# CS50-Final-Project
Nutrition is a topic full of mystique, but it doesn't have to be. An approach known as IIFYM ("If It Fits Your Macros") is meant to demistify nutrition, empowering people to fit their preferred foods into a diet instead of relying on the same generic 'diet foods' as everyone else. Unfortunately, giving someone a list of daily macronutrients and telling them to hit those numbers is often overwhelming to a person with no previous familiarity with nutrition. I hope this app helps bridge the gap, so more people can have a more flexible diet and still reach their goals.

This is a web app to provide meal quantities that fit given macros. The user chooses one algorithm based on their preference. Then, she inputs macros and/or calories, as well as a food list. The app then tells the user how many grams of each food on the list would be enough to hit their macro targets.

The next time someone needs to figure how what a meal of 100g of carbs, 40g of protein, and 15g of fat looks like, they can just input their preferred ingredients, and know exactly how much to each of each food.

DISCLAIMER: this app is not nutrition advice. Consult with a registered dietitian before starting a diet. There is more to nutrition than merely macros.
